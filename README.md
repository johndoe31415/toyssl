# toyssl
This is a toy SSL library that I wrote back in 2015 to get a more thorough
understanding of TLS and specific TLS bugs. This code in its current form is
likely entirely broken, I'm not developing this further. However, I'm pushing
it to GitHub so I can pick and choose specific aspects of it that I want to
reuse for [x509sak](https://github.com/johndoe31415/x509sak).
